# Chaos-Game
A Pygame program that simulates the Chaos Game theory to generate a fractal. 

1) Draw three dots in the form of a triangle
2) Start at point 1
3) Randomly choose a point 1-3
4) Draw a dot in the middle of those two points
5) This dot is your new point
6) Repeat from step 3 continuosly

You wil eventually draw the Sierpinski triangle
